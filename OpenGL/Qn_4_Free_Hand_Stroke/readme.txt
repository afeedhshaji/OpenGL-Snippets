Write a program in which you can make strokes by holding down the mouse left
button, dragging and releasing. The path (stroke) traced out by the mouse
pointer between the events of mouse's left button click and the eventual release
of the left click needs to be plotted. There can be any number of strokes. Using
this concept write your name on the screen. Note:- Make the background white and
the strokes black in color.
