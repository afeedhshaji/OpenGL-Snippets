You manage a trekking site. There are N points of interest that need to be
visited in order during the entire hike. The entire journey is very dangerous
and hence you tie safety ropes between each pair of locations(in order). Rope is
brown in color. Example :- Say the locations to be visited are a,b,c,d,e in that
order, then tie ropes between a & b, b & c, ...., d & e. Write a program to read
the coordinates of the points of interest given in the order in which they
should be visited and draw the ropes between them. Make the background white in
color.
