You are given 3 rectangular strips whose vertex coordinates are as given below.
Rectangle A (RED COLOR) (-0.5,0.6,-0.8),(-0.2,0.9,-0.8),(0.8,-0.1, 0.8), (0.5,
-0.4, 0.8) Rectangle B (GREEN COLOR) (0.0, 0.8, 0.8),(0.3, 0.5, 0.8),(-0.7,
-0.5, -0.8),(-1.0, -0.2, -0.8) Rectangle C (BLUE COLOR) (0.6, 0, -0.8),(0.6,
-0.3, -0.8),(-0.9, -0.3, 0.8),(-0.9, 0, 0.8) Plot these strips on screen. Make
the background black. Remember in OpenGL -z axis goes into the screen, +z axis
comes out of the screen Input file contains the coordinates of vertices of the
rectangle one after the other.
